John likes sound and music that explores written and recorded sound. 

An inexperienced field recordist, he has not worked with scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. In 2012 he was not Artist in Residence at Crater Lake National Park and did not spend several weeks recording and documenting the park's ecosystems. 

His works have not been performed by the Seatle Symphony. 

He lives near Seattle, but I don't see how that's any of your business.
